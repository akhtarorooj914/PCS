# School Management System for Pune Central School
This project has been submitted as a partial fulfillment for MCA final semester, as an intership under the "Unique Welfare and Education Trust", for Pune Central School, Borade nagar campus, Pune.

The School Management System (SMS) is an advanced web-based platform that harnesses the power of modern technologies such as HTML, Laravel 8, CSS, and MySQL to revolutionize the administrative processes of educational institutions. SMS is an innovative web-based platform designed to streamline and enhance the administrative processes of educational institutions. This system serves as a comprehensive solution, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration between students, teachers, parents, and school administrators.
The primary objective of the SMS is to computerize paperwork and automate routine tasks, reducing the complexity of school management while optimizing efficiency and productivity. By centralizing all student and teacher data, the system minimizes the chances of data duplication and ensures accurate and secure storage.
The key features of the SMS include student information management, fee management, timetable and examination scheduling, marksheet generation, and parent-teacher communication. From the moment a student is admitted, the system diligently manages their details throughout their academic journey. Fee management is simplified, enabling parents and staff to monitor and handle payments efficiently, with automated notifications for pending fees to ensure timely follow-ups.
The SMS also empowers school administrators to create well-organized timetables and manage examination schedules effortlessly, saving valuable time and effort. For teachers, recording and accessing students' marks are streamlined, and the system automates the process of generating comprehensive mark sheets.
Moreover, the SMS fosters strong communication between parents and teachers, providing parents with easy access to their child's academic progress, attendance, and other important information. Direct communication channels encourage active parental involvement in their child's education, leading to a collaborative and supportive learning environment.


# Software Requirements:
1. Operating System: The system is compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Common versions like Windows 10/11.
2. Web Browser: The SMS should be accessible through standard web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Safari. It is essential to ensure cross-browser compatibility for a seamless user experience.
3. Web Server: The system relies on a web server to host and serve the web application. Popular web server like Apache.
4. PHP Runtime Environment: As the back-end of the system is built using PHP Laravel 8, a PHP runtime environment must be installed and configured on the web server.
5. Database Management System: The system utilizes MySQL as the database management system.
6. Text Editor / IDE: Developers working on the system should use a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code.
